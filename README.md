## About Us
We all try to work on becoming self employed and collaborate as partners and all this remote and with a lifestyle of traveling.

## About Backends
The only thing that a backend is supposed to do (if clients cant do it without) is to connect clients to each other, so that they can communicate and exchange data. Our idea is, that apps connect p2p without servers... like as if desktop apps would connect directly to each other... In rare cases where this needs servers to make it work we will build them, but usually it works without.

## About Frontends
* Frontend is the new FullStack.
* A traditional backend can be built into the client like https://github.com/mafintosh/browser-server
* not every app needs servers
* when app need servers, they might be existing ones (e.g. facebook, twitter, github, google drive, ...)
* sometimes you need generic ones, like databases or real time connection across different users (e.g. firebase, pusher, pubnub)
* sometimes you have clients that already have backends (e.g. written in PHP, Java, Ruby, Python, ....) that you can connect to via API
* Our way of thinking about apps is:
  1. you build an `index.html` which is like a traditional desktop app
  2. you start it by opning the `index.html` in your browser
  3. once the `index.html` app started, it might connect to one or more "backend servers" via API and send or receive data
